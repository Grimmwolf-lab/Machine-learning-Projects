# Machine-learning-projects
I will be adding projects related to machine learning and data science.

In this section I have learned some basic concepts of scikit-learn and it's workflow.
Some of the main topics were:-
1.Choosing a estimator/model using sklearn estimator map.
2.Preprocessing data using sklearn and categorical encoding.
3.Building a pipeline for all that preprocessing steps.
4.Hyperparameter tunning using GridSearchCV ,RandomizeSearchCV and manually.
